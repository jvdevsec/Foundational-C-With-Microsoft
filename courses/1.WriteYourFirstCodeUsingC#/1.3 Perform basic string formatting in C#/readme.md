# Perform basic string formatting in C\#

## Introduction

As a software developer, you'll need to write C# code to combine and format
literal and variable data to create a new value. That value might be displayed,
saved to file, or sent across the network.
Fortunately, C# provides a number of ways to format strings.

Suppose you want to display the output of a command-line application you're
writing. You want to display values including literal text, text in variables,
numeric data, and textual data in other languages. How would you format it
correctly so that the user can understand what your application is communicating
to them?

### Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create string data containing tabs, new lines, and other special characters.
- Create string data containing Unicode characters.
- Combine string data into a new string value via concatenation.
- Combine string data into a new string value via interpolation.
