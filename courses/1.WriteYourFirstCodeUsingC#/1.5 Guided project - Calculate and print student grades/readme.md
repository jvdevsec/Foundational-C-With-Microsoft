# Guided Project: Calculate and print student grades

## Introduction

Developers perform some tasks nearly every day. Tasks including declaring string
and numeric variables, assigning and extracting values, and performing
calculations are routine, but essential. Equally important is the task of
communicating results to the application user. Mastering the ability to apply
these skills to solve a given problem is something that every developer must
learn to do.

Suppose you are a teacher's assistant at a school. You're tasked with developing
an application that automates student grading. The application uses all of the
scored assignments for each student to calculate their current overall
grade/score for the class. The teacher has also provided a required format for
reporting the student grades.

This module will guide you through the steps required to develop your Student
Grading application. Your code will declare and assign values to variables based
on student names, perform various numeric calculations, and display the results.
Calculations include determining the sum of assignment scores and calculating the current grade for each student. To display the results in the required format, you'll use `Console.WriteLine()`, as well character escape sequences
that will help format your results.

### Learning objectives

- Work with variables to store and retrieve data
- Perform basic math operations
- Format strings to present results
